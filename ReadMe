In this project, I will use CSS Flexbox to create a responsive grid layout for an e-commerce website. I will design the grid layout to include multiple rows and columns of products such as electronics, shoes, clothes, etc. Additionally, I will ensure the layout can reorganized on different screen sizes using media queries. I will use media queries to adjust the layout of the grid to suit various screen sizes.
